**🍕Pizza Hut Sales Data Analysis - SQL Project**

Welcome to the Pizza Hut Sales Data Analysis project, where I utilized SQL to extract meaningful insights from a comprehensive pizza sales dataset. This project delves into customer preferences, sales trends, and revenue generation, showcasing how SQL can be leveraged for data-driven decision-making and business growth.

🚀 **Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing Pizza Hut's sales data to uncover valuable insights that can drive strategic business decisions. By creating a relational data model and using SQL queries, I was able to answer a variety of business-critical questions:

🔍 **Key Focus Areas:**

Total orders placed and revenue generated 🍕💰

Identifying the highest-priced pizza on the menu 🍕🔥

Determining the most common pizza size ordered 📏

Highlighting the top 5 most ordered pizza types (by quantity) 🥇🥈🥉

Exploring order patterns by time of day and pizza category distribution ⏰🍕

**📊Data Model Overview**

To make sense of the sales data, I developed a robust relational data model consisting of the following four key tables:

**Orders**: Stores order IDs, dates, and times of the transactions.

**Order Details:** Captures the quantities of each pizza ordered per transaction.

**Pizzas**: Includes the price and size information for each pizza.

**Pizza Types:** Classifies pizzas into different categories and provides details about the ingredients.

This data model allows for seamless data retrieval through well-structured SQL queries, providing a comprehensive view of sales trends, revenue, and customer preferences.

💡 **Key Insights and Results**

Through this analysis, I uncovered several valuable insights:

A breakdown of total sales revenue and the most popular pizza types.

Identification of the highest-priced pizza and analysis of its impact on revenue.

Insights into the most commonly ordered pizza size and customer preferences.

A detailed examination of order distribution across different times of the day, helping to identify peak sales periods.

**📈Business Impact**

This analysis enables businesses to:

Understand customer demand: By identifying top-selling pizzas and preferred sizes, businesses can better cater to customer needs.

Optimize offerings: Adjust menu items based on revenue contribution and customer preferences.

Drive growth: Leverage data-driven insights to shape marketing strategies, manage inventory, and boost revenue.

**💻 Technology Used**

**SQL:** Core language for querying the pizza sales data and extracting insights.

**Relational Database:** Structured data modeling to facilitate efficient queries.

**Data Visualization:** Optional for presenting the results (if applicable).
